# Human Activity Recognition

A wed application which based upon deep learning 
model, which takes input from per-recorded video 
footage and recognise human activities using 
Convolutional neural network(CNN) and Long-Short term 
memory(LSTM)




## Prerequisites

Make sure you have already installed:

Python version 3.8 

TensorFlow 2 

OpenCV – 3.4.16 

keras 2.6.0 


All the frames extracted from videos were re-sized to 224 × 224 shape to feed the to the model.
## Data Set
UCF101 dataset
